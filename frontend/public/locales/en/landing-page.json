      "1": {
        "question": "Do I have to enter every meal manually?",
        "answer": "Initially, you build your own database of your favorite meals and recipes. You do this only once. Afterwards, you build diets like LEGO bricks—just drag and drop your ready-made meals into any client's plan. It becomes your personal digital cookbook."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "Is it really faster than Excel?",
        "answer": "Definitely. In Excel, you have to manually recalculate macros every time you change a portion size. Vitema recalculates everything automatically in real-time. Plus, you can copy an entire week's plan to another client in seconds."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Is the app available on iPhone (iOS)?",
        "answer": "Currently, we have a native app for Android. The iOS (iPhone) version is our top priority on the roadmap. Until then, iPhone users can use the fully responsive web version in their browser."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Can I add my own logo?",
        "answer": "We plan to introduce White-Label features (your logo and colors) in a later development stage. Currently, we are focusing 100% on the system's core functionality and stability."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "What if a client dislikes a meal?",
        "answer": "You don't need to rewrite the whole plan. Just click 'Swap' on that specific meal and replace it with another option from your database. The client's shopping list will update automatically."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
